            <h2>The Importance of Linguistics in Student Achievement</h2>
            <p>It has been well established for a while that “Research on language-minority student outcomes has revealed sizeable and persistent achievement gaps.” 
            <br><br>
            In “The Effect of Community Linguistic Isolation on Language-Minority Student Achievement in High School,” Drake found that “language minority achievement gaps are three to five tenths of a standard deviation in reading and math but that the effect is attenuated by increased levels of linguistic isolation.” His detailed results, below, clearly show the disadvantage language minorities face, scoring between 5 and 6 points lower in math and reading in 10th grade.
            <br><br>
            This disadvantage makes sense. Language is the medium by which we disburse knowledge, and accordingly, we should expect that students less fluent in this medium will not perform as well. It’s important, however, that we take steps to address this, and teachers are capable of doing this. In this curriculum, we’ll delve into some methods teachers can utilize to engage and support their language minority or linguistically diverse students.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>Engage students by drawing on their cultural backgrounds - and if you don’t know it, learn about it</h3>
            <p>Dialect awareness programs seek to infuse the fundamental principles of linguistic variation into school curricula. The program excites students about the inherent variability of language and meets standards proposed by the International Reading Association and the National Council of Teachers of English, indicating that students should “develop an understanding of and respect for diversity in language use, patterns, and dialects across cultures, ethnic groups, geographic regions, and social roles” (Alim, 2005, pg. 27)<br><br>
            According to one teacher who worked closely with the Latino community, most teachers could predict little of the problems their new students would encounter. Most knew little about poverty. They had little notion of why working parents might not be able to make midday appointments with their children’s teachers. They suspected disinterest, apathy, and even antagonism and were baffled and troubled by the failure of these parents to “care” about their children. (Valdés, 1998, pg. 5)
            White parents became worried. They were afraid of lowered academic standards, of the problems that might accompany non-English background students, of gangs, of violence, and of interethnic romance. (Valdés, 1998, pg. 5)  <br><br>      
            In imagining the teaching of English for the Elisas and the Lilians of the world, I envision a critical pedagogy that, as Simon (1986) has pointed out, does not merely involve helping students to "make it," but rather involves trying to change the ways students understand their lives and the possibilities with which they are presented. Critical language study, according to Fairclough (1992, p. 7), is "an orientation towards language" that "highlights how language conventions and language practices are invested with power relations and ideological processes which people are often unaware of." It would be important, for example, for Elisa to examine exactly why ESL ghettos exist and to find a voice with which to name the very powerful and real barriers that stand in the way of her dreams.  (Valdés, 1998, pg. 5)<br><br>
            There are many things, however, that these legislators do not know. They do not know, for example, that--as was the case for Lilian and Elisa--in many all-English  programs, children have very little access to English...English language learners are segregated from their English-speaking peers. (Valdés, 1998, pg. 13)<br><br>

            <h3>Support students specific linguistic needs by acknowledging their legitimacy and importance</h3>
            <p>Teachers should distinguish between mistakes in reading and differences in pronunciation. For instance, if a Black child reads, “I missed my chance” as “I miss my chance,” teachers should not view this as a decoding error, but rather as an utterance that is consistent with the pronunciation patterns of BL. (Alim, 2005, pg. 27)
            The “contrastive analysis” approach can be used to distinguish the differences between “standard English” and BL...A vivid example of the potential success of this approach in teaching “standard English” writing skills is noted in the work of Taylor (1989), who showed that students taught by this method had a 91.7% decrease in their use of third-person singular without the ﬁnal s (a well-studied feature of BL), while those taught by more traditional means only had an 11% decrease. (Alim, 2005, pg. 27)<br><br>
            “Dialect readers” introduce reading in the home and community language of the students and then later make the switch to “standard English”...Black students achieved 6.2 months of reading gain in a 4-month period, while a control group taught by traditional methods actually lost ground in that same period. (Alim, 2005, pg. 27)
            In the current context in which anti-immigrant sentiment is at an all-time high, newly arrived children are routinely accused by the general public of not wanting to learn English and of failing to profit from the education that the state is giving them at great cost. (Valdés, 1998, 13)<br><br>

            <h3>Empower students to take control of their learning</h3>
            <p>Lee described, for instance, a literature unit on symbolism that drew on students’ cultural data sets, or everyday cultural knowledge, that included rap lyrics and short films that were steeped in symbolism. In this form of instruction, she posited, classroom talk and participation structures necessarily change as students, who are experts of their cultural data sets, educate their teachers about cultural concepts with which they may be unfamiliar. Teachers then scaffold students’ transfer of discourse about local knowledge into academic language. <br><br>
            Taken together, this research underscores the fact that this supposedly monolithic group of students exhibits diverse and expansive linguistic repertoires, which include “standard” English,“standard” Spanish, regional and vernacular dialects of both languages, various indigenous languages, Spanglish/Spanish-English code-switching, and interpreting/translating, among other everyday language practices.  Noting that such resources are often overlooked in schools, these scholars have emphasized the potential for leveraging Latina/o students’ language practices and experiences as resources for teaching and learning in English language arts classrooms. Orellana et al., for example, suggested that bilingual Latina/o students’ experiences translating and interpreting between languages can be used to support the within-language paraphrasing that is valued as an academic literacy skill in schools.<br><br>

            <p>Talk to your students about cultural icons or other activities they enjoy outside of school. Try to use what your students indicate they’re excited about in your next lesson plan.</p>
            <h4>Example: Music and Haikus</h4>
            <p>Without any cultural context, Haikus may seem like fairly arbitrary pieces of poetry. They are short and not commonly found in the modern world. You have talked to your students and realized that most of them enjoy hip hop. You find a backing track online and challenge your students to fit haikus into the beat.
